<h3 align="center">Champions React App</h3>

  <p align="center">
    Champions is a dynamic e-commerce app based upon recruiting characters (referred to in-app as "Champs") from the popular online video game,  League of Legends. This passion project served as a way for me to learn in-depth about JavaScript and React, and allowed me to experiment with implementing both these features into something I have built.
